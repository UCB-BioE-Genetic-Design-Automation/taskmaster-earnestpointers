This little experiment is to see if I can use a non-replicative lambda red to do knockin/knockout.


PCR with oligos that add Pcon-J23119 (highest) off pKD46 picking up lambda red and their terminator.  Also PCR a genomic knockout cassette, perhaps dapD?  Whatever.  Probably not dapD.  I then mix the two DNAs with zymo10B cells, do different amounts, but expect high to be best.  Sit on ice 6 min, then rescue at 37 and plate.

Oligos are designed to have a BamHI/BglII recircularization.  I should test recircularized and just linearized.
