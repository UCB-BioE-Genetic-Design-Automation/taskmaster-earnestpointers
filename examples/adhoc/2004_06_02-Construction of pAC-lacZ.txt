Digest pBADmychisLacZ	(3200 bp, NcoI/HindIII)
Sub into pAC708		(NcoI/HindIII)
Product is pAC-lacZ, 5335 bp
-----------------------------------------------
put library into xhoi/hindiii sites after linker insertion
include a stop right before hindIII
-------------------------------------------


NEW PLAN

put pG80-Pbad-CmR into the genome on a pG80, confirm phenotype (want G80 without AraC, the existing strategy does that)
do PCR library directly off pBADmychislacZ...include AraC and lacZ, use BsaI, should be just one
oligo, other comes from araC-kid expts
there is no BsaI site until after lacZ anyway
sub directly into pBAC568 (or pG80-568) go into a GH::pG80-PbadAraC, outgrowth, select for CmR
	Then secondary screen for blue clones
